# Test strict key checking functionality
# Aligned with tavern-py commit 3838566: Add 'strict' argument to recursive key checking
# This is what we expect from /fake_dictionary endpoint:
# top:
#   Thing: value
#   nested:
#     doubly:
#       inner: value
# an_integer: 123
# a_string: abc
# a_bool: true
