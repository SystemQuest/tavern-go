## Commit Information
- **Hash**: da8ed22d94c9918099fad407b0d6c4ae368f412d
- **Author**: Michael Boulton <boulton@zoetrope.io>
- **Date**: Fri Feb 23 09:37:07 2018 +0000
- **Message**: "Add a comment about the verbs which shouldn't have a body"

## Changes Overview

### Modified Files
- `tavern/request/rest.py` - Added explanatory comment

### Detailed Changes

**Added Documentation Comment**:
```python
# These verbs _can_ send a body but the body _should_ be ignored according
# to the specs - some info here:
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods
if request_args["method"] in ["GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"]:
    if any(i in request_args for i in ["json", "data"]):
        warnings.warn("You are trying to send a body with a HTTP verb that has no semantic use for it", RuntimeWarning)
```

### What This Commit Does

1. **Adds Documentation**: Adds a clarifying comment above the GET/HEAD/OPTIONS body warning
2. **Provides Context**: Links to MDN documentation explaining why these verbs shouldn't have bodies
3. **No Functional Changes**: Pure documentation improvement, no code behavior changes

## Synchronization Assessment

### Status: ✅ **Recommended - Add Comment**

### Reasoning

1. **Documentation Value**: The comment provides important context about HTTP semantics
2. **Developer Education**: Helps developers understand WHY the warning exists
3. **Reference Link**: MDN link is valuable for developers who want to learn more
4. **Complements Previous Sync**: We already implemented the warning in commit 631f20c (sync of 8d4db83)

### Implementation in tavern-go

**Location**: `pkg/request/rest_client.go`

**Current Code** (after commit 631f20c):
```go
// Check for body with methods that semantically shouldn't have one
if (method == "GET" || method == "HEAD" || method == "OPTIONS") && body != nil {
    logrus.Warnf("You are trying to send a body with HTTP %s which has no semantic use for it", method)
}
```

**Recommended Addition**:
```go
// These verbs CAN send a body but the body SHOULD be ignored according to the HTTP specs.
// While technically allowed, it's semantically incorrect and many servers/proxies may reject or ignore the body.
// Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods
if (method == "GET" || method == "HEAD" || method == "OPTIONS") && body != nil {
    logrus.Warnf("You are trying to send a body with HTTP %s which has no semantic use for it", method)
}
```

## Impact Analysis

### Benefits of Syncing
- ✅ Better code documentation
- ✅ Helps developers understand HTTP semantics
- ✅ Provides reference for further learning
- ✅ Aligns with tavern-py's educational approach

### Risks
- ⚠️ None - pure comment addition

### Estimated Effort
- **Very Low** - Single comment addition (~3 lines)
- **No Tests Required** - Documentation only
- **No Behavior Changes** - Zero functional impact

## Recommendation

**Should Sync**: ✅ **YES**

**Priority**: Low (documentation improvement)

**Action Items**:
1. Add explanatory comment above the validation code in `rest_client.go`
2. Include MDN reference link
3. Optional: Commit with message referencing da8ed22

**Example Commit Message**:
```
docs: Add explanatory comment for GET/HEAD/OPTIONS body warning

Aligns with tavern-py commit da8ed22: adds context about HTTP semantics.

Clarifies that while these verbs CAN send a body, they SHOULD NOT
according to HTTP specifications. Includes MDN reference link.

Sync Status:
- tavern-py commit: da8ed22 (2018-02-23)
- Status: Documentation synchronized
```
